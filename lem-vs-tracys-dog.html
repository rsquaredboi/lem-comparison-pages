      <div class="verdict-header">🏆 The Bottom Line</div>
      <p>These two serve different purposes. Tracy's Dog OG Pro 2 is a budget dual-stimulation device ($40-50) for users who want both clitoral suction and G-spot vibration. The Lem is a premium single-purpose air-pulse device ($89) that does one thing exceptionally well. If your priority is <strong>the best possible clitoral stimulation with premium build quality and discretion</strong>, the Lem wins. If you want an affordable multi-purpose device and don't mind trade-offs in quality, Tracy's Dog is functional.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">How Air-Pulse Technology Works</h2>
    <hr class="section-divider">
    <div class="verdict" style="margin-bottom:0;">
      <p>Air-pulse technology works fundamentally differently from traditional vibrators. Instead of surface-level buzzing, it creates gentle suction and pulsating air waves around the clitoris — stimulating thousands of nerve endings without direct contact. This touchless approach often leads to faster, more intense orgasms with less desensitisation over time.</p>
      <p>The Lem uses a precision-engineered air-pulse motor with 8 intensity levels and 4 rhythmic patterns. The sealed medical-grade silicone nozzle creates a focused pocket of oscillating air pressure that mimics the sensation of oral stimulation. Because there's no direct friction, many users report being able to experience multiple orgasms in a single session — something that's harder to achieve with traditional vibrators.</p>
      <p>Both the Lem and the Tracy's Dog OG Pro 2 use variations of this core technology, but the quality of the motor, the seal of the nozzle, and the material of the tip all dramatically affect the real-world experience. Medical-grade silicone creates a better seal and softer contact than ABS plastic or lower-grade alternatives, which is why the Lem's build quality matters.</p>

        <h3>140% Longer Battery Life</h3>
        <p>120 minutes vs ~50 minutes. The Tracy's Dog has one of the shortest battery lives in the category — barely enough for a single session. The Lem gives you over two hours of reliable use per charge. This alone can be a dealbreaker.</p>

        <h3>Purpose-Built Excellence</h3>
        <p>The Lem does one thing — air-pulse clitoral stimulation — and does it brilliantly. Tracy's Dog tries to combine suction and G-spot vibration in one device, which means neither function is as refined as a dedicated device. The suction motor, in particular, is noticeably weaker than the Lem's.</p>

        <h3>Compact &amp; Discreet</h3>
        <p>The Lem is a tiny lemon (7.8 x 5.1 cm). Tracy's Dog is a larger, dual-function device with an unmistakable shape. For storage, travel, and privacy, the Lem is in a different league entirely.</p>

        <h3>Dual Stimulation</h3>
        <p>The OG Pro 2 combines clitoral suction with a curved G-spot vibrator in one device. If you want both external and internal stimulation simultaneously without buying two separate toys, this is a genuine advantage.</p>

    <div class="faq-list">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Is the suction on Tracy's Dog as strong as the Lem? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>No. The Tracy's Dog splits its motor power between suction and G-spot vibration. The Lem dedicates its entire motor to air-pulse stimulation, resulting in stronger, more focused clitoral sensation.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Why is the Tracy's Dog battery so short? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Running two motors (suction + vibration) simultaneously drains battery faster. At ~50 minutes, it's one of the shortest in the category. The Lem's single-motor design lasts 120 minutes — 2.4x longer.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Can the Lem provide G-spot stimulation? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>The Lem is designed specifically for external clitoral air-pulse stimulation. If you want G-spot stimulation too, consider pairing the Lem with a separate internal toy — you'll get better quality on both fronts than a single combo device.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Is the Lem worth the extra $40? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>If clitoral stimulation is your priority, absolutely. The Lem delivers superior air-pulse quality, 120-min battery (vs 50 min), medical-grade silicone, whisper-quiet operation, a discreet design, and a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How do I clean the Lem compared to the Tracy's Dog? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Both are waterproof, but the Lem's compact, seamless medical-grade silicone body is significantly easier to clean. Tracy's Dog's larger dual-function shape has more surface area and crevices around the insertable arm that require careful cleaning. Rinse the Lem under warm water with mild soap — its smooth design means no hidden spots for bacteria.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Is the Lem good for travel? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>The Lem is one of the most travel-friendly pleasure devices available. At just 7.8 x 5.1 cm, it fits easily in a toiletry bag or handbag. Its lemon shape won't raise eyebrows at airport security. It also features a travel lock to prevent accidental activation. Tracy's Dog's larger shape is harder to pack discreetly and is immediately recognisable.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What warranty does the Lem come with? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>The Lem includes a 12-month warranty against manufacturing defects plus a 30-day satisfaction guarantee — if you're not happy, Hello Nancy provides a courtesy refund. Tracy's Dog offers a 12-month warranty but no satisfaction guarantee, and their customer support can be harder to reach.</p></div>
